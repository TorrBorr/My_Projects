Movie data from 2006 to 2017 is used to describe movie Gross and movie IMDB ratings.   Linear regression with a 
single feature, budget, was used. 

The first figure shows the Gross model (red) compared to the data points (blue). The prediction interval is shown
with black line.
Similarly, the second figure shows IMDB rating (red) compared to the data points (blue) with the prediction 
interval as black lines. 

Future work includes adding the additional features of movie genre, director, and production comany to the model 
for both Gross and IMDB score. 
Additionaly, the budget coefficient is quite small for IMDB rating, so various transformations should be 
explored to further investigate.
